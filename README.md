piLED
======
A status indicator plugin for a RaspberryPi Minecraft server

This application dispalys the status of a Minecraft server on external LEDs.

Server is online (GPIO18) 
LAN players present (GPIO23) 
Internet players present (GPIO24)
Sound may still be implemented later but for now I can't think of a suitable new name to change it to.

Current status

Detection of player type code implemented
LED control code implemented 
Stripboard prototype working

Future enhancements
Include schematic for breadboard (although it is just 330Ohm resistors and LEDs to each GPIO pin)
